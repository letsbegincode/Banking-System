## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at `maintainers@example.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
